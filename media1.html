                Blast disease, caused by the fungus Pyricularia oryzae  is one of the most destructive diseases of rice plants. It affects various parts of the rice plant, 
                including leaves, stems, nodes,and grains to significant yield losses.
            <br>
,symptoms are:

Leaf Blast,Node Blast,Node infectionNeck Blast,Panicle neck rot,Collar and Leaf Sheath BlastLesions can also form on the collar and leaf sheaths, weakening the plant and further contributing to yield losses.
            </br>
            <br>
            To prevent and manage this disease, we use Resistant Varieties,Crop Rotation,Proper Planting,Sanitation etc.

            <p>Brown spot, caused by the fungus Helminthosporium oryzae (also known as Cochliobolus miyabeanus), primarily affects rice plants but can also attack other cereals. The disease causes small, round to oval brown lesions on the leaves, leaf sheaths, stems, and grains. Over time, these lesions may expand, leading to a "blighted" appearance of the leaves.
                <br>  
                symptoms of this are:
                Leaf Spots,Grain Infection ,Reduced Photosynthesis,Pre-harvest Yield Loss.
            </br>
            To prevent Helminthosporium oryzae (Brown Spot) in rice plantstjta is
            Resistant Varieties,Nutrient Management,Proper Water Management,Field Sanitation,Apply fungicides  timely like(Mancozeb,Carbendazim,Tricyclazole),Seed Treatment.

            <p>Sheath blight, caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, primarily affects rice plants, but can also impact other crops like soybeans and vegetables. The disease manifests as water-soaked lesions on the leaf sheaths, which can coalesce into large, irregular patches. As the disease progresses, these patches can turn brown and dry out, leading to reduced photosynthesis and lower yields.
              <br>
                To prevent Rhizoctonia solani (Sheath Blight) in plants, we Use disease-resistant or tolerant rice varieties,Remove plant debris and weeds to reduce fungal sources,Avoid waterlogging and ensure proper drainage in fields, Ensure adequate spacing to promote air circulation and reduce humidity.

            <p>Rice Leaf Curl Virus (RLCV) is a significant disease that affects rice crops. When rice plants are infected by a leaf curl virus, they can show  symptoms that affect plant growth and yield.
            <br>
            symptoms are:Leaf curling,Stunting,Chlorosis,Tillering reduction.
        </br>
        <br>Preventing the Rice Leaf Curl Virus (RLCV) and other similar viral diseases in rice largely  we have to use Plant virus-resistant rice varieties,Biological control(Predators,Parasitoids),
Chemical control etc.

            <p>The White Tip Nematode (Aphelenchoides besseyi) causes a disease commonly known as "White Tip Disease" in rice.
                <br>
                 Some symptoms are:White Tips,Stunted Growth,Reduced Grain Yield etc.
            </br>
            <br>
            Hereâ€™s a detailed approach to prevention: Resistant Varieties,Crop Rotation,Sanitation etc.
