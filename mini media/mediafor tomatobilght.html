            <h1>Tomato Blight Disease</h1>
            <p>Tomato Blight is a serious disease affecting tomato plants, characterized by a variety of symptoms that can lead to significant yield losses.
                 The term "blight" can refer to different diseases that impact tomatoes, but the two most common types are Early Blight and Late Blight.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Cause:</div>
            <p>Fungal Pathogen: Alternaria solani is the primary cause of Early Blight.
                <br>
                Symptoms:
            </br>
            1.Leaves: Circular, dark brown to black spots with concentric rings (target-like appearance) on older leaves.
                <br>
            2.Fruit: Dark, sunken lesions on the fruit, especially when the disease is severe.
        </br>
            3.Stem: Dark lesions on stems and branches can also occur.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Prevention:</div>
            <p>1.Use Resistant VarietiesChoose tomato varieties that are resistant to blight. Many commercial varieties are bred to resist common blight pathogens.
                <br>
                2.Proper Spacing:Space plants adequately to ensure good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity and limits the conditions that favor fungal growth.
            </br>
                3.Crop Rotation:Rotate crops each year to minimize the risk of blight. Avoid planting tomatoes or related plants (like potatoes) in the same soil for several years.
               <br>
                4.Proper Watering:Water plants at the base rather than overhead to keep the foliage dry. Avoid watering in the evening to reduce humidity around the plants.
        </br>
                5.Remove Infected Plants: Regularly inspect plants and remove and destroy any infected parts or plants. Properly dispose of infected plant material to prevent the spread of disease.
