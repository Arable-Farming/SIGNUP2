            <h1> Apple Scab  Disease</h1>
            <p>Apple scab is a fungal disease caused by Venturia inaequalis that affects apple and crabapple trees. It primarily targets leaves, fruit, and young shoots,
                 leading to dark, sunken lesions and a reduction in fruit quality. The disease thrives in cool, wet conditions, particularly during spring when the fungus releases spores.
                 Infected leaves can cause premature leaf drop, impacting tree health and fruit production. 
            </p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Cause:</div>
            <p>
            Apple scab is caused by the fungal pathogen Venturia inaequalis, which infects apple trees under specific environmental conditions. Several key factors contribute to the development and spread of apple scab:
<br>
            1. Cool, wet weather:- The fungus thrives in temperatures between 18-24°C (64-75°F) and requires frequent moisture, such as rain or dew, for spore germination and infection.
    <br>
        2. Springtime conditions:- Infections often begin in the spring when the fungus releases spores during periods of prolonged wetness. These spores can then infect newly emerging leaves and blossoms.
        <br>
        3. Infected plant material:- Overwintering in fallen leaves, fruit, and other debris, *Venturia inaequalis can release spores in the spring to infect healthy plants.
        <br>    
        4. High humidity:- Persistent high humidity and prolonged leaf wetness provide an optimal environment for fungal growth and spore dispersal.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Prevention:</div>
            <p>Preventing apple scab involves several key practices:
                <br>
                1. Use resistant varieties:- Select apple trees that are less susceptible to scab.
                <br>           
                2. Apply fungicides:- Use preventive fungicides, especially during wet periods, following recommended guidelines.
                <br>
                3. Improve orchard sanitation:- Regularly remove and dispose of fallen leaves and fruit to reduce fungal spores.
                <br>
                 4. Enhance air circulation:- Prune trees to ensure good airflow and reduce moisture buildup.
                 <br>
                 5. Avoid overhead irrigation:- Use drip irrigation to minimize leaf wetness.</p>
