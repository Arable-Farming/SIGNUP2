            <h1> Potato Blight Disease </h1>
            <p>Potato blight, also known as late blight, is a plant disease caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans. It primarily affects potato and tomato crops, leading to the rapid decay of leaves, stems, and tubers. The disease thrives in wet, 
                humid conditions and spreads quickly through spores in the air or water. Severe outbreaks can devastate entire crops, causing significant agricultural and economic losses. Potato blight was responsible for the Irish Potato Famine in the 1840s.
                 Effective management includes using resistant varieties, fungicides, and crop rotation.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Cause:</div>
            <p>Potato blight is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans, a type of water mold. The primary factors that contribute to the spread of this disease include:
<br>
                1. Wet and humid conditions: Blight thrives in environments with high moisture and temperatures between 10-25°C (50-77°F).
            </br>
                2. Poor air circulation: Dense plantings or low-lying areas with poor airflow promote the retention of moisture on leaves.
               <br>
                3. Contaminated soil or plant material: Infected potato tubers, soil, or plant debris can harbor the pathogen and spread it to healthy plants.
        </br>
                4. Wind and rain: Spores are easily carried by wind and rainwater, spreading the disease across fields and regions.
                <br>
                5. Inadequate crop management: Lack of crop rotation and failure to use resistant potato varieties increase susceptibility to blight.</p>
    
            <div class="section-title">Prevention:</div>
            <p>Preventing potato blight involves a combination of good agricultural practices and careful monitoring. 
                Farmers should plant blight-resistant potato varieties and use certified, disease-free seed tubers.
                 Crop rotation helps break the disease cycle by avoiding planting potatoes in the same soil year after year.
                  Maintaining proper plant spacing allows for better air circulation, reducing moisture buildup on leaves. 
                  Regularly applying fungicides, especially in humid conditions, can protect plants from infection.
                   Removing and destroying infected plants helps limit the spread of the disease. 
                Lastly, monitoring weather conditions and acting early can prevent severe outbreaks.</p>
