            <h1> Rice Blast  Disease</h1>
            <p>Rice blast is a fungal disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae that affects rice crops worldwide. 
                It damages all parts of the rice plant, including leaves, stems, nodes, and panicles, leading to stunted growth and reduced yields.
                 The disease thrives in warm, humid conditions, especially in areas with frequent rain or irrigation.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Cause:</div>
            <p>Rice blast is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which infects rice plants under favorable environmental conditions. Several factors contribute to the spread and severity of the disease:
<br>
                1. Warm, humid climate: The fungus thrives in temperatures between 25-30°C (77-86°F) and in areas with high humidity or frequent rainfall, creating ideal conditions for spore germination and infection.
                <br>
                2. Excessive nitrogen fertilization: Overuse of nitrogen fertilizers makes rice plants more susceptible to blast by encouraging lush, dense growth, which traps moisture and fosters fungal growth.
                <br>
                3. Poor field drainage: Waterlogged or poorly drained fields promote humidity, providing a favorable environment for the fungus to proliferate.
                <br>
                4. Dense planting: Closely spaced plants restrict air circulation, allowing moisture to linger on leaves, which increases the risk of infection.
                </p>

            <div class="section-title">Prevention:</div>
            <p>1.Use Resistant Varieties:Plant blast-resistant rice varieties that have been bred for resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. Many modern rice varieties are designed to withstand the effects of the fungus.
                <br>
                2.Seed Treatment:Use certified disease-free seeds or treat seeds with fungicides before planting to reduce the risk of introducing the pathogen to the field.
                <br>
                3.Proper Water Management:Maintain a consistent water level in the field, especially during the early stages of plant growth. Proper irrigation management helps reduce the chances of spore germination and disease spread.
                Avoid excessive periods of water stress or drought, as this can make plants more susceptible to infection.
                <br>
                4.Balanced Fertilization:Apply balanced amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. Excessive nitrogen can promote lush, dense growth, which makes the plant more susceptible to rice blast.
                <br>
                5.Field Hygiene:After harvest, remove and destroy infected crop residues (such as straw and stubble) that can harbor fungal spores.
