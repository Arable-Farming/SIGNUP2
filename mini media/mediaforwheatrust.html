            <h1>Wheat Rust  Disease</h1>
            <p>Wheat Rust Disease is a significant plant disease affecting wheat crops worldwide. It is caused by several species of the fungus Puccinia, with the three main types being:
                <br>
                Types of Wheat Rust Disease:
            </br>
            
              1.Stem Rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici):

                Affects the stems and leaves of wheat plants.
                Forms reddish-brown pustules on the stems, leaves, and spikes.
        <br>
                2.Leaf Rust (Puccinia triticina):
                
                Primarily affects the leaves of wheat plants.
                Produces small, round, reddish-brown pustules on the upper surfaces of leaves.
               
        </br>
               3. Wheat Yellow Rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici):
                Affects the leaves and stems, causing yellowish-orange pustules.
                Also known as wheat stripe rust.</p>
            
            <div class="section-title">Cause:</div>
            <p>Fungal Pathogen: The disease is caused by different species of the fungus Puccinia. These fungi produce spores that spread the disease from plant to plant.
                <br>
                Environmental Conditions: Wheat rust fungi thrive in warm, humid conditions. High humidity and mild temperatures are ideal for spore germination and disease development.
                Infected Seeds: Disease can spread from infected seeds or plant debris.
            </br>
                Wind and Rain: Spores are dispersed by wind and rain, facilitating the spread of the disease over large areas.</p>

            <div class="section-title">Prevention:</div>
            <p> 1.Use Resistant Varieties:

                Plant wheat varieties that are resistant to the specific types of rust prevalent in your area.
                <br>
                2.Crop Rotation:
                
                Rotate crops to disrupt the life cycle of the rust fungi. Avoid planting wheat or other susceptible crops in the same field consecutively.
            </br>
                3.Proper Planting Practices:Avoid dense planting which can create a microclimate conducive to rust development. Ensure adequate spacing between plants for good air circulation.
            <br>
                4.Fungicide Application:Apply fungicides as a preventive measure or when the disease is detected. Choose fungicides effective against the specific type of rust affecting the crop.
        </br>
                5.Remove Infected Plants:Regularly inspect crops and remove and destroy infected plants or plant debris to reduce the source of inoculum.</p>
